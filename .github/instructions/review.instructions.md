# Code Review

Review the selected code thoroughly and provide feedback on:

1. Bugs & Issues: Any potential bugs, edge cases, or logic errors
2. Performance: Inefficient operations, unnecessary computations, memory issues
3. Security: Potential vulnerabilities, injection risks, data exposure
4. Readability: Unclear naming, complex logic that could be simplified
5. Best Practices: Violations of common patterns or conventions

Format your response as:
- Bugs (critical issues)
- Performance (optimization opportunities)
- Security (vulnerabilities)
- Readability (clarity improvements)
- Suggestions (nice-to-haves)

Be specific with line numbers and provide code examples for fixes.
